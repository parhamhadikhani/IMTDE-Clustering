# Improved data clustering using multi-trial vector-based differential evolution with Gaussian crossover
An Improved clustering using multi-trial vector-based differential evolution with Gaussian crossover

## Introduction
an Improved version of the Multi-Trial Vector-based Differential Evolution (IMTDE) algorithm is proposed and adapted for clustering data. The purpose here is to enhance the balance between the exploration and exploitation mechanisms in MTDE by employing Gaussian crossover and modifying the sub-population distribution between the strategies.
