# Improved data clustering using multi-trial vector-based differential evolution with Gaussian crossover
An Improved clustering using multi-trial vector-based differential evolution with Gaussian crossover

## Introduction
an Improved version of the Multi-Trial Vector-based Differential Evolution (IMTDE) algorithm is proposed and adapted for clustering data. The purpose here is to enhance the balance between the exploration and exploitation mechanisms in MTDE by employing Gaussian crossover and modifying the sub-population distribution between the strategies.

Multi-Trial Vector-based Differential Evolution (MTDE) is an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm that is done by combining three strategies and distributing the population between these strategies to avoid getting stuck at a local optimum. In addition, it records inferior solutions to share information of visited regions with solutions of the next generations. This repository contains, contains the implementation of the Improved version of the Multi-Trial Vector-based Differential Evolution (IMTDE) algorithm for clustering data. The purpose IMTDE is to enhance the balance between the exploration and exploitation mechanisms in MTDE by employing Gaussian crossover and modifying the sub-population distribution between the strategies.
